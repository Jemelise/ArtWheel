# ArtWheel

The data collected within ArtWheel will help the travelling artist organize their business,
allowing them to spend more time in the studio. ArtWheel will be a useful collection of data provided
by an artist that will help the user maintain inventory, sales, customer information, mileage, tax data,
and event information. By minimizing the necessary documents needed and reducing the redundancy of
information entered, travelling artists will have a tool that they can carry with them between shows,
and utilize during shows, giving them the foundation for success.
